### Organisation Name : NIT Rourkela - Project Avocado Web

 Overview
 
# Contributions
  - Added new route in the dashboard ‘/ics-team/mentee’
  - Worked on the frontend of the mentor and mentee pages of the ics-team

# New Features
  - A mentee can input their roll number on the mentee page of ics-team and it will display the mentee details and the mentor allocated to the mentee (The later part is in progress, I couldn’t complete the later part because of an unresolved issue)
  - A mentor can input their roll number on the mentor page of ics-team and it will display the mentor details and the mentee allocated to the mentor (The later part is in progress, I couldn’t complete the later part because of an unresolved issue)

# Small Bugs
- I faced issues with displaying the mentor and mentee data after making call to the queries,it isn’t getting displayed properly.

Here are some of [my PRs](https://github.com/dscnitrourkela/project-avocado-web/pull/45) 

# Future Scope
Although the time I spent on this project is short(because of my exams and one month time constraint of this programme), I think this project has a lot of potential to solve the problems of students and teachers in their campus by using in-demand technologies to make an impact.
If I got opportunity to contribute more, I would like to work on the backend side of the project as well.

# Overall Experience
Working on project avocado web has made me a better developer and a quick learner,I went through the basics and worked with many technologies like GraphQL,React,etc in a very short span of time.
I am thankful to the mentors Abel Matthew and Ritesh for helping and guiding me throughout the process and making the learning experience exciting.
