### DSC-X : IWasAt.Events

DSC-X is a one of the university base community groups for the students interested in Google developer technologies. Students grow their knowledge through peer- to - peer learning environments and build solutions for real-time problems.

[IWasAt](https://sairish2001.github.io/omgframestesting.github.io/) is one of the projects of DSC-X which aims at providing badges for all the events that happen across the Student Clubs. Students can upload their photograph and get their amazing event badges in different shapes and sizes.Participants can add these badges across various social media platforms in order to showcase their participation. 

I am [Awantika Nigam](https://github.com/awantika10), an undergraduate student in Electronics and Communication from [Lakshmi Narain College of Technology,Bhopal](https://lnct.ac.in/), as a part of [Winter of Code](https://winterofcode.com/). This project was mentored by [Anubhav Singh](https://github.com/xprilion)

The project was focused on making badges for the students all over more user friendly and  progressive . I worked equally on number of other features which involved creating wireframes, designs, mockups and Front-End of the website. 
To sum things up, this was a great full-stack project and I enjoyed working on designing part of DSC-X!

# New Features
I have designed the following features into DSC-X regarding IWasAt.events
- [[Feature : UI/UX] Frame Generator Dashboard](https://github.com/dsc-x/omg-frames/issues/1)
  - The Frame Generator consists of nav bar at the top with logo at the left , login functionality at right with undo and redo buttons.
  - The dashboard window is divided into two parts, first with a panel at left for changing the frames, styling the text, adding icons and uploading the user's image and second is the workspace for making the frames.
  - The workspace will also contain options for aligning the image and changing its orientation.
  - Download and Share buttons will be available below the frame.
- [[Feature : UI/UX] Website for IWasAt.events Badge Generator](https://github.com/dsc-x/omg-frames/issues/1)
  - Login/SignIn : User can simply login and register themselves through the website by clicking on "Login".
  - For viewing the badge generator dashboard the user needs to hit "View Dashboard" button.
  - In order to view the previously made badges you need to click on "View Gallery" option.
  - The website will be available in Dark Mode as well.
- [[Feature : UI/UX] Wireframe of the gallery ](https://github.com/dsc-x/omg-frames/issues/1)
  - Designed a simple wireframe of the gallery with home, dashboard and login option at the Nav bar.

# Overall Experience
I got introduced to DSC-X last year and from the very beginning, I loved the OMG -Frames objective and friendly environment, thanks to [Anubhav Singh](https://github.com/xprilion) for helping me with the onboarding and valueable feedbacks through your reviews. I am very thankful to [Rajinder Pal Singh](https://github.com/sairish2001) and [Arnab Sen](https://github.com/arnabsen1729).
