# DSC NIT Rourkela: Project – Avocado 

Refactor of code to have proper state management in appointment page, Creating a Firebase Analytics service under services.     

The project was an upgrade to better documentation of the home page in MVVM (model-view,view-model) architecture. The home page of the app is where all the features of the app are accessed from by hundreds of students everyday. My work over this winter made the documentation of the code better and the improved state management made the code more readable and easy to maintain for any future changes.

I am Priya Mishra, an undergraduate student from Mumbai University, as part of Winter of Code.

This project was mentored by – Abel Matthew, Chinmay kabi, and Smarak Das and the project had constant guidance from all three of them.

# Future Scope of Work :

Though my time spent on the project is short, I believe my work has made a significant impact in the maintainability of the code put In by many contributors like myself. Suffice to say that the work has only begun and the conversion of all other pages of the app to MVVM architecture will take place subsequently.
