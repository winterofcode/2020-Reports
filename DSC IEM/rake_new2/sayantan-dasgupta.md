### DSC IEM : rake_new2

 The project I had worked on was [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/BALaka-18/rake_new2/tree/feature-addition/feature_enhancements/sayantandasgupta_feature_sentiment-analysis).

 This feature analyzes the sentiment of the piece of text as provided by the user.

 My work in this project has added a sentiment analysis feature to the library [rake_new2](https://github.com/BALaka-18/rake_new2).

 I am [Sayantan Dasgupta](https://github.com/Arka2001) from [IEM, Kolkata](https://iem.edu.in) as part of [Winter of Code](https://winterofcode.com).

 This project was mentored by - [Balaka Biswas](https://github.com/BALaka-18)
# Contributions
  - 1. ###Sentiment Analysis
        In this task, I was responsible for provideing a sentiment analysis feature to the project.
        It only requires a large corpus of text to work on.
        All code was written in sync with the rake_new2 tech stack and styles.

Here are some of [my PRs](https://github.com/BALaka-18/rake_new2/pull/36) 

# Future Scope
I hope my contribution to the rake_new2 library has helped in its overall functionalities and efficiency.

I would like to add some more features to this library like a language translator.

The feature that I have added would be very helpful for industrial purposes because it is very important to learn about the sentiments of the general public.

I am looking forward to contributing more to this library.

# Overall Experience
I have had a great winter. With the WoC 2020, I had a great time in learning something new and also to start contribute to industry level projects. I have gained quite a lot of confidence after the completion of this project. My mentor, Balaka Biswas, was most helpful and cleared all of my doubts with patience. I want to thank her heartily because my project would have not been completed if it wasn't for her guidance.

WoC would remain a memorable experience for me.
