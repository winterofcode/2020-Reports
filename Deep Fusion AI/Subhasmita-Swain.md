### Deep Fusion AI : Social Distance Detector

This project aimed to build a light weight and accurate mobile friendly  Social Distance Detection model. My work throughout this month was to produce a viable python script for detection (using avalable Tensorflow Models) and enumerate a distance measurement algorithm between pedestrians.

I am [Subhasmita Swain](https://github.com/SubhasmitaSw) an undergraduate from Sharda University, as a part of Winter of Code.

This project was mentored by [Sayak Paul](https://github.com/sayakpaul) and [Rishiraj Acharya](https://github.com/rishiraj).

# Contributions
   Here's my [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZSdQ3eVCBLejNgE-f96fHHv1eEohlp7s?usp=sharing) notebook containing my work.
- Tested different pre-trained TF models for their performance compyling to the Detector
- Prepared detection and distance measurement algorithm scripts using ssd-mobilenet-v2 model
- Tested the performance of TinyYOLO on NVIDIA Jetson Nano V2
- Provided Documentation for the final project.
  

# Issue
- Here's the [Issue](https://github.com/DeepFusionAI/social-distance-detector/issues/6#issuecomment-751362640), I've co-worked on. 
 

# Future Scope
With the upcoming support of TFLite for the EfficientDet model can help improve the accuracy and speed of the Social Distance Detector with more mobile-friendly models.
Also with further Optimization of the model we could push the perfromace bar ahead a little. 

# Overall Experience
The constant support and relentless doubt clearings from my mentors Sayak Paul and Rishiraj Acharya helped develop my technical side as well gave me an insight about professional work culture.
I would also like to Thank my teammates Piysuh, Sudarshana and Hiran, I've learnt a lot from you.
