# Future Scope
I hope my work on Automatic Spell Check & Topic Modelling help to improve the rake_new2 library.

Both of the feature could be helpful in various official purposes and also help rest all existing features.

Both Automatic Spell Check & Topic Modelling can be really helpful for finding Sentiment of Statements which is really important now a days .

I hope my contributions will help other future contributions.

I'm looking forward to contribute more to this library and improve the main keyword extractions algorithm
