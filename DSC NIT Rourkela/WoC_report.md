# Overview 

Refactor of code to have proper state management in home page , Creating a shared Preference service under services.     

The project was an upgrade to better documentation of the home page in MVVM (model-view ,view-model) architecture. 
The home page of the app is where all the features of the app are accessed from by hundreds of students everyday. 
My work over this winter made the documentation of the code better and the improved state management made the code 
more readable and easy to maintain for any future changes.

I am Rahul Balaji, an undergraduate student from NIT Rourkela, as part of Winter of Code.

This project was mentored by – Abel Matthew, Chinmay, and Smarak. The project had constant guidance from all three of them.

# Contributions 

# 1) setting up a shared preferences service :

  in this task, I was responsible for creating a function to return an 	instance of sharedPreferences, 
  and a function to save different types of content to disk using sharedPreferences. The issue is linked below.

	#177 – Services - Create a sharedPreferences service.

# 2) ViewModels – HomePage View Model :
	
  in this task, I was responsible in creating the view and view model of the home page, refactoring the code and tweaking 	
  minor errors that came along the way for the smooth functioning of the home page of the project.

  During this task, I got into discussions about the MVVM architecture and resolving relevant errors with Smarak and 	
  Chinmay. After a few suggested changes, the issue was finally closed. The issue is linked below.

	#178 – ViewModels – HomePage View Model.

# here are some of my PRs :

1. https://github.com/dscnitrourkela/project-avocado/pull/180
2. https://github.com/dscnitrourkela/project-avocado/pull/196

# Future Scope of Work :

Though my time spent on the project is short, I believe my work has made a significant impact in the maintainability of the code put 
In by many contributors like myself. Suffice to say that the work has only begun and the conversion of all other pages of the app to 
MVVM architecture will take place subsequently.
